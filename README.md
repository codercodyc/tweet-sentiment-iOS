# tweet-sentiment-iOS

This is an app I created while going through Angela Yu's iOS Development course on Udemy.

It is using a machine learning model to analyze tweet sentiments. When you enter a twitter tag such as `@Apple` or `#blessed` it will pull 100 tweets with that tag and analyze the sentiment of each tweet.
The app then calculates the overall sentiment and displays a corresponding emoji.
